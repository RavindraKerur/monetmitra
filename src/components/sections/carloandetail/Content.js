All banks offer you the foreclosure or prepayment facility. Some of the banks takes a penalty fee for that and some may allow you to do so without charging any penalty fee. Prepayment of loan will release your car from hypothecation and gets you the full ownership.</p>

Up to 150% of the carâ€™s value can be availed as a top-up loan. For you to avail a top-up on your car loans will need to have maintained a clear payment record for at least 9 months.

Car Refinancing is generally used by customers for features such as low interest rates, to increase tenures, or to change the terms of the existing loan. In any of the cases, customers generally go for Car Refinancing to save money.</p>

One needs to know that refinancing car loan is not a right choice when you have already made a substantial repayment, or if the car value has depreciated, or the foreclosurecharges are high, and when you have plans to apply for new loans in the future as refinancing may impact your credit score negatively.</p>
